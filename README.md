# Quant Scholarship Program
This repository contains the files and source codes that I created during my participation in Quant Scholarship Program organised by Credit Suisse.

So far:
- Learned how to use the F# language to simulate stochastic processes and stock prices,
- Learned some financial terms and basics of the Blackâ€“Scholes model.
